					<h1 class="sub-judul">CODING</h1>
					<p class="kolom-kolom">The other day I read this post and was inspired by it so much! Catlin Tucker outlines the reasons she is passionate about teaching. Since I am really connected to education (I taught at a university) this very simple idea really resonated with me. So simple yet so powerful! Today I don’t teach anymore but I am still passionate about my day to day work: Coding! I love it so much that when people ask me how I can do “the same work” for so many years I always answer that “I have never worked a day in my life since my work is also my hobby :)”</p>

					<h1 class="sub-judul">DESIGNING</h1>
					<p class="kolom-kolom">Everywhere you look, you’re taking in detail and drawing inspiration. There are the expected places, like design blogs, sites like Dribbble, beautiful collections of inspiring design on sites like Muz.li, etc. But the main source of design inspiration comes from EVERYTHING — the shade of the orange on your countertop, the shape of a lamp post, the design on a comforter, the shading created by a shadow on the sidewalk, the vibrance of flower petals — there is a never ending stream of inspiration everywhere you look. I like experimenting.</p>

					<h1 class="sub-judul">PROGRAMMING</h1>
					<p class="kolom-kolom">I like creating something out of nothing. That's not literally what you do when you're programming, because there's existing hardware and software that serves as a foundation for your work, but it sure feels that way. Someone has an idea and you build it from the ground up. When you begin, there's just an empty text editor. When you're done, there's a (hopefully) working program. I like building things people use. It's amazing to type up some code, press a button, and suddenly thousands of people on the Internet are playing with it.</p>
